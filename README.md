# startup

A few things that I learned from the GitHub assignment:
1. Having a cloud-based repository can help with not only version control, but assist in collaboration as well.
2. The pattern to follow when developing is:
    1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
    2. Make changes to the code
    3. Commit the changes (git commit)
    4. Push the changes to GitHub (git push)

Things that I've learned from the Simon project:
-Sometimes you need to modify file permissions in order to execute a script
-Building a form with HTML is actually quite easy
-HTML without any CSS styling can look very, very boring!
-Writing HTML is similar to typing and formatting a Word document

Things that I learned from Simon CSS:
-Bootstrap is an easy way to make HTML look like an actual, legitimate website
-To add CSS, you can simply put all your CSS code in one file and link to it from each of the HTML files
-If done right, elements on a webpage should all be able to re-size depending on the size of the device that the page is being viewed on

Things that I learned from building my startup HTML and CSS:
-It is easiest to work in stages. Build out the HTML, and then style with the CSS. Don't worry about the style while you're writing the HTML
-Let Bootstrap do the heavy lifting. Don't overthink it, it's likely that there is a Bootstrap style for what you are trying to do
-Put thorough comments in your code. It makes it a lot easier to read and understand when you come back a few days later
-Don't overcomplicate it. Plan out your site before you start writing code or else you're never going to get what you actually want
