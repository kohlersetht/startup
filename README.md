# startup

A few things that I learned from the GitHub assignment:
1. Having a cloud-based repository can help with not only version control, but assist in collaboration as well.
2. The pattern to follow when developing is:
    1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
    2. Make changes to the code
    3. Commit the changes (git commit)
    4. Push the changes to GitHub (git push)

I'm seeing if I can make this work right now.
