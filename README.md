# startup

A few things that I learned from the GitHub assignment:
1. Having a cloud-based repository can help with not only version control, but assist in collaboration as well.
2. The pattern to follow when developing is:
    1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
    2. Make changes to the code
    3. Commit the changes (git commit)
    4. Push the changes to GitHub (git push)
